    <h2>Please wait...</h2>
    <p>The <pre>Webstack</pre> service is not yet in the <pre>:running</pre> state.</p>
    <p><b>Every 5 seconds, the status is being checked. You will be redirected when it is online.</b></p>
    <p>
      This is a superficial block, because the <pre>WebSocket</pre> server is still accepting connections,
      and <pre>Sinatra</pre> is still serving up public files, like this one. This point of this page
      is to show you that this service is stated, and its state needs to be handled properly.
