Carrying on the tradition of distributed [`Celluloid`](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) actors started by [`DCell`](https://github.com/celluloid/dcell), which implements [`Celluloid::ZMQ`](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-zmq); `ECell` introduces a new *strategic* perspective on distributed [`Celluloid`](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) actor meshes.

## Originators

This codebase was originally developed by @[digitalextremist]((https://github.com/digitalextremist) on behalf of his company [emotivemediums](https://github.com/emotivemediums), which was commissioned by @[rjattrill](https://github.com/rjattrill) on behalf of his employer [Energy One Limited](https://github.com/energyone). The original concepts were first given form as a working demonstration of a new microservices framework, based on the company's existing extensive use of [`Celluloid`](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) and [`Reel`](https://github.com/celluloid/reel). This incarnation as `ECell` is an extraction of the framework from the original work, but now it is even more so the result of @[benzrf](https://github.com/benzrf) taking part in the [2016 Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6688531397214208/) ( `GSoC` ).


## Work In Progress

The form this framework exists in now is the result of combining the styles and approaches of both @[digitalextremist]((https://github.com/digitalextremist) and @[benzrf](https://github.com/benzrf). It is currently in a transitional state -- freshly done with this `GSoC` season. Please feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/celluloid/ecell/issues) for bug reports, feature requests, *and* for discussion of key concepts while the framework is hardened and polished in the immediate future.
