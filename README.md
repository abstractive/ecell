Carrying on the tradition of distributed [`Celluloid`](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) actors started by [`DCell`](https://github.com/celluloid/dcell), which implements [`Celluloid::ZMQ`](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid-zmq); `ECell` introduces a completely new perspective on distributed [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) actor meshes.

## Distributed + *Strategic* + Concurrent

# Key Components

Following the theme of drawing or painting on a canvas, these are the foundational pieces you have to work with:

## `Design` objects: *Behavior* elements.

## `Shape` objects: *Ability* elements.

## `Line` objects: *Connecting* elements.

## `Pattern` objects: *Directional* elements.

## `Color` objects: *Message* elements.
